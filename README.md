This program uses the Tiny Web Server to allow a user to input a zipcode on the browser, the program then takes that zipcode, sends it to api.openweathermap.org, parses the returned JSON for the temperature, and displays the temperature in Fahrenheit for the user on the browser.
To use: run ./tiny [port], then connect on your browser to http://ada.sterncs.net:[port]/cgi-bin/SemesterProject and then enter your zipcode when prompted
